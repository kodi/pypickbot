PyPickupBot is a small-sized IRC bot primarily aimed at gaming channels.

The main purpose of PyPickupBot is to run pickup games: Players sign up for one, and once a game is deemed to have enough players, captains will be picked from the signed-up players and will start picking players in the aim of playing an organized team game.

PyPickupBot however isn't limited to this activity, which can be in fact disabled entirely, at the same title as any loadable modules. It can be extended at will with plugins that contribute to different tasks: channel management, etc.

This guide is a tutorial in the configuration and basic use of PyPickupBot.
